A fun little Facebook(Meta)-like application here. Lots of ins and outs with this project during construction. I enjoy React! It's the most challenging, maybe that's why I enjoy
it the most, who knows!? However, this was a fun one. It's interesting to me the ways a React project comes together. Something I learned in this project is that proper files
and folders and their directories, especially whem importing them, is paramount. This is super important to have a fully functioning and easily editable and most importantly
readable experience for the user. I plan to do more React projects just like that to sharpen and improve my React skills.
